# aws-iot-rpi-fleet-provisioning

This CDK stack generates a custom raspbian image which automates onboarding of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) devices to [AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/).

## ðŸ”– Features

- Create a custom raspbian based image which:
    - Enables connection to a WiFi network.
    - Sets a unique hostname for the device based on its Ethernet MAC address. As an example a Ethernet MAC address of **dc:a6:32:01:23:45** will result in a hostname of **dca632012345**.
    - Requests a fully functional identity on first boot with the necessary IoT permissions that the device can use for subsequent communication with AWS IoT Core.

## ðŸŽ’ Pre-requisites

- The [aws-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) must be installed *and* configured with an AWS account on the deployment machine (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html for instructions on how to do this on your preferred development platform).
- This project requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). To make sure you have them available on your machine, try running the following command.
```sh
yarn -v && node -v
```

## ðŸš€ Install

### 1/ Create a secret to store the password for the Wifi network used by your devices

You can do it from the AWS console or from the command line:

```sh
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name RPI_WIFI_PASSWORD \
    --description "RaspberryPi Wifi Password" \
    --secret-string 'redacted'
```

### 2/ Update the stack configuration

Update the Wifi network SSID/country and timezone in [lib/utils/constants.ts](lib/utils/constants.ts) file.

### 3/ Deploy the stack

Deploy this stack to your AWS account/region:

```sh
yarn && yarn build
yarn cdk deploy '*'
```

## ðŸ›  Usage

The CDK stack creates a [Codebuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) project which builds the custom raspbian image and stores it in [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Once the stack is deployed, you can check the progress of the Codebuild project in the AWS console. Once the build is completed, download the custom raspbian image from S3 (Check the "Artifacts upload location" in the Codebuild project to find the S3 bucket).

![Artifacts upload location](../images/codebuild_artifact_location.png)

Unzip the image and write it on your Raspberry Pi sd card

```sh
unzip aws-raspbian.zip
# Find the SD card external disk
diskutil list external
# Write the image (replace /dev/disk123abcd with the name of the SD card external disk)
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk123abcd
sudo dd bs=1m if=aws-raspbian.img of=/dev/disk123abcd conv=sync
```

A Raspberry Pi booting using this image will automatically requests a fully functional identity on first boot with the necessary IoT permissions that the device can use for subsequent communication with AWS IoT Core (see [provisioning-client/firstboot.sh](provisioning-client/firstboot.sh)).
