# Device Fleet Provisioning with AWS IoTCore

Client used to provision devices using a AWS IoT fleet provisioning claim.

This client is a modified version of the [aws-iot-fleet-provisioning sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-fleet-provisioning) which allows to pass the device serial ID as an argument and delete bootstrap certs once provisioning completed.
